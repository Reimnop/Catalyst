# Catalyst

A next-generation performance mod for Project Arrhythmia &mdash; Successor of Potassium.

**Does not enhance the Editor!**

## Installation
> [!WARNING]\
> Catalyst does not work on the `alpha` branch. This is an [issue with BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/issues/536), not Catalyst.

1. Open the **Project Arrhythmia folder**.
	- ℹ️ _Right-click on **Project Arrhythmia** in your Steam library > **Manage** > **Browse local files**._
1. Download the corresponding version of **BepInEx** and copy the contents of the archive into the **Project Arrhythmia folder**:
	- For **\[21.12.2\]** *(default branch)* get [BepInEx 6 x64 IL2CPP](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v6.0.0-pre.1/BepInEx_UnityIL2CPP_x64_6.0.0-pre.1.zip).

	- ℹ️ _If you can't open the archive, try using [7-Zip archiver](https://7-zip.org/)._
1. Launch Project Arrhythmia once and then close it.
1. In the Project Arrhythmia folder, go to `BepInEx` > `plugins`.
	- ℹ️ _If you do not see the folder, then you haven't installed BepInEx properly. Try following the previous steps again, or ask for help._
1. Download the corresponding version of [Catalyst, and Catalyst.Engine](https://github.com/Reimnop/Catalyst/releases) and move them into the `plugins` folder.
